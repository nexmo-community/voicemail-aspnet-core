## Welcome to Vonage

<!-- change "github-repo" at the end of the link to be the name of your repo, this helps us understand which projects are driving signups so we can do more stuff that developers love -->

If you're new to Vonage, you can [sign up for a Vonage account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up?utm_source=DEV_REL&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=github-repo) and get some free credit to get you started.

This application assumes that you have a Vonage API Account, and an application configured to receive calls on a Vonage API https://developer.nexmo.com/concepts/guides/webhooks

## Configuring the App

Configure the app by editing the `VonageVoicemail/appsettings.json` file and replacing the `APP_ID` and `PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` fields with your application ID and a path to your private key.

Run the app with `dotnet run`
